# Introduction to Copilot for Microsoft 365

### Prompting

Prompting is the process of asking Copilot for help. You can ask Copilot for help in various ways, such as in a chat window, in a document, or in a service. Copilot can help you with a wide range of tasks, such as writing emails, creating presentations, and analyzing data. You can ask Copilot for help by typing a question or a command in the chat window, or by selecting a command from a list of suggestions. Copilot will then provide you with a response that is tailored to your needs.
