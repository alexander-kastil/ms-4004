- Ask for a market analysis

  I'm the Director for Market Research for Tailspin Toys, a U.S. based toy manufacturer. Conduct a market analysis of the toy industry to identify sales figures, the latest trends, consumer preferences, and the most popular toys in the market.
  ```

- Enhance the analysis

  ```
  That analysis was great. However, I'm also interested in including data on the toy industry, including market share and consumer feedback. Please amend your prior analysis to include this information. Thanks!
  ```

  ```
  I think all the data is complete. With all the information that you captured, please analyze the data and identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help me determine what Tailspin Toys' business plan should be for the upcoming year.
  ```

  ```
  Please analyze the data in this market analysis and business plan. Is there any other information that a toy company would typically request for market analysis and business plans that I failed to request? If so, can you please amend your responses to include this information. Thank you!
