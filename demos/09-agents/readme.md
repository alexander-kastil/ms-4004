# No-Code-Agents

Everyday business users with no programming background can build and manage no-code agents in both Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. These agents are AI-driven chatbots that provide basic functionalities and personalized assistance. When you create a no-code agent, you can either base it on a predefined template that contains preconfigured options and rules, or you can create a custom agent based on options and rules that you define.

No-code agents don't include advanced features like generative AI, which require more complex algorithms and processing capabilities. Key features of no-code agents include:

Ease of use. Everyday users can create and manage no-code agents directly within SharePoint and Copilot Chat. You don't need any coding skills to create these agents.
Personalized assistance. These agents provide tailored assistance based on the specific content and context the user assigns to the agent.
Permission compliance. No-code agents adhere to the permissions set within Microsoft 365, ensuring users only see content they're allowed to access.
