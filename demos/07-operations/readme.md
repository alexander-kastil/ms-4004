 I'm the Operations Manager for Adatum Corporation. We're thinking about possibly replacing our building's current boiler system with a furnace system. Write a report describing what type of boiler systems are used in most commercial buildings, and include what considerations I need to take into account to change from an existing boiler system to a furnace system, the average cost of transitioning from a boiler system to a furnace system in a commercial two-story building built in the 1970s, whether changing from a boiler system to a furnace system will have any effect on our current air conditioning system, and the average defect rates for boiler systems versus furnace systems.
